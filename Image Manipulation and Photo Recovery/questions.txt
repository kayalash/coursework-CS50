0.  BMP - Varying number depending on # of bits; 32-bit BMP supports 4,294,967,296 colours
    GIF - Supports 256 colours
    JPEG - 16 Million
    PNG - 24-bit PNG supports 16 million colours; 48-bit PNG supports 281 Trillion colours

1.  GIF is the only format to support animation

2.  Lossless compression results in a reduced file size of a perfect copy whereas lossy
    compression results in a much smaller file size of a not perfect copy that may seem
    to be a perfect copy
    
3.  JPEG is the only of these formats that are lossy-compressed

4.  The system modifys the first character of the file to indicate that the file has been 
    deleted. Then, the file  moves to a the hard drive's list of free clusters intact
    
5.  You can use one of the freely avaliable tools that make disk sanitization easy to wipe
    your hard drive clean before you discard it
    
6.  stdint.h is a library that includes new types of ints with a fixed size 

7.  Using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t is to specify the number of bits that 
    can be used to form an integer, keeping the value of an int between a specific minimum 
    and maximum
    
8.  BYTE - 1 byte
    DWORD - 4 bytes
    LONG - 4 bytes
    WORD - 2 bytes
    
9.  The first two bytes must be B and M.

10. bfSize is the size of the entire bitmap file in bytes whereas biSize is the number of 
    bytes required by the structure
    
11. If biHeight is negative, it means the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is in the 
    upper-left corner 
    
12. biBitCount

13. fopen may return NULL if it can't find the file specified

14. The third argument to fread is always 1 becuase the third argument to fread specifies the 
    number of elements to be read, and since for all fread lines 1 arguments is read, which are 
    structs, the third argument is always 1 
    
15. 3

16. fseek changes the file position of the stream, which in this case is the inptr

17. SEEK_CUR specifies that the offset should occur relative to the current position of the file
