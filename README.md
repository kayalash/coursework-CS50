# CS50 Coursework
This is some coursework I did for CS50 which is an online course that I took. I highly recommend it 
if you are just starting out in your computer science career: https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x

Projects include:
- Game of Fifteen
- Image Manipulation and Photo Recovery
- Simple Encryption Algorithims
- Simple Server Files
- Spell Checker

Most, if not all of these programs are written in C. It was a great hands-on way to learning the intricacies of a
relatively low-level programming language like C. 

I'm hoping in the future to learn more about servers to create my own website entirely form scratch from beginning to 
end. 

Feel free to take a look at the programs and remember to check out this great course at the link above.
